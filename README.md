# Custom-ESP32-board
Custom ESP32 boarThis project is a custom ESP32-S3-MINI development board designed to improve my hardware design skills using Altium Designer. I created a 4-layer PCB focused on clean layout, proper power handling, and modern interfaces.

Key Features:
Replaced micro-USB with USB-C for power input.

Swapped CP2102N for FT231XQ-R USB-UART chip due to better community feedback.

Designed full 4-layer stackup to practice signal integrity and layout techniques.

Skills Learned:
4-layer PCB design and stackup planning

USB-C and USB-UART interface design

ESP32 schematic design and layout in Altium

Component selection, labeling, and documentation
